Sublime Text 3 plugin which allows users to send and receive text messages.

## I Don't Want My Contacts Stored On The Could!

We don't want it either! So we didn't!

The only information sent to the SubTexting server is: 1) Contact name and 2) the local id* of the contact. Plus they are only stored temporarely!

###"Local id of the contact? I don't get it.." 

Well! Let us explain! We don't want to be sending the number of your contacts around! So instead, we just pass the id of a contact. That Id is stored only on your device! Say you have a contact whose name is "John Smith" with the phone number: (574) 000 - xxxx. When you first saved that contact, your phone stored it with an id. Say the id is 234. Now, when you upload your contact so it can be accessed be the SubTexting, we won't be sending John's number. Instead, we'll send his id. In addition to that, the SubTexting server will store that information temporarely! Once you pull that information down using the plugin, that information will be deleted from our servers!
